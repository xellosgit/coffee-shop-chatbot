Welcome to Merry's Way Coffee, your neighborhood coffee shop located in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City. At Merry's Way, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a moment of joy, and a way to connect with others.

Our Story
Founded in 2015, Merry’s Way started as a small family-owned café with one mission: to share the love of quality, ethically-sourced coffee with our community.

Merry's passion for travel and coffee led her on a journey across South America, where she handpicked partnerships with small farms and cooperatives. We ensure that every cup we brew tells a story of dedication and care, from farm to table. Our beans are roasted in-house to bring out unique flavors that reflect the regions where they were grown.

Delivery & Locations Served
In addition to offering a cozy place to enjoy coffee in our café, we proudly deliver to Greenwich Village, SoHo, West Village, and Lower Manhattan. Whether you’re at home, in the office, or enjoying a day at Washington Square Park, we bring your favorite coffee right to your door. Just a click away, our delivery service ensures that you never miss your daily cup, no matter where you are.

Our Menu
Our menu offers something for everyone, from our signature espresso blends to refreshing cold brews, artisanal teas, and fresh-baked goods sourced from local bakeries. We also cater to a variety of dietary needs with a range of plant-based milk options and gluten-free snacks.

Community & Sustainability
At Merry's Way, we are more than just coffee. We are part of the community, and we care deeply about sustainability.
